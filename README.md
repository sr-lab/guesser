# Guesser
Sometimes you just need a super-simple list-based password guesser that will take a plaintext list of guesses, a plaintext list of attacks and tell you how many guesses you got right.

## Overview
Takes two lists, one of guesses and one to be guessed, and tells you how many matches turn up. Does some other small stuff like deduplicating guesses. Wrote this in C# fast because I want to use it from Windows.
